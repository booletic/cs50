2.          lossless is a compression method to display image with no degradation in accuracy.
            lossy is a compression method to display image with some degradation in accuracy.

3.          JPEG is lossy.

4.          On FAT system, when a file is deleted 2 things happen, first, the file name flags the file indicating
            that the file is deleted and can be recycled, second the flagged file to a free cluster, thus the fi-
            le can be recovered using data recovery programs.

5.          To ensure that files I delete cannot be recovered is by overwriting the data with random bits, and
            the best practice is Gutmann method.

6.          stdin.h is a part of stdio.j {stdin, stdout, stderr}
            stdin is an input stream
            stdou is an output stream
            stderr is an error message stream

7.          The point of using uint8_t, uint32_ti, nt32_t and uint16_t is to allocate the exact amount of data, which is as per
            Bitmap specification in this case.
            
8.          BYTE    is 1 byte
            DWORD   is 4 bytes
            LONG    is 4 bytes
            WORD    is 2 bytes

9.          using xxd, bmp has a magic number of 0x42 0x4d

10.         bfSize is the bitmap the data which is 246.
            biSize  is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER which is 40 when running: ./copy smiley.bmp copy.bmp

11.         biHeight    if positive, a bottom-up DIB, this means the origin starts at the lower-left corner.
            biHeight    if negative, a top-down DIB, this means the origin starts at the upper-left corner.
            
12.         biBitCount and in running: ./copy smiley.bmp copy.bmp, it states that smiley.bmp is 24-bit. 
            
13.         fopen open can return null if it can't find the file or the running program doesn't have the privilege to access the
            file.
            
14.         1 is the number of elements to read, and since we are reading a struct 1 will do.

15.         padding =   (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4
                    =   3
            
16.         fseek will adjust the stream indicator to offset "in this case padding" the current indicator.
            
17.         SEEK_CUR is the current position of the indicator
